ðŸ“ˆ Stock Movement Predictor
This project is a machine learning web app that predicts whether a stock will go up or down tomorrow based on technical indicators. The user enters a ticker symbol (like AAPL), and the app uses real-time market data to make a prediction.

- Fetches live data from Yahoo Finance via yfinance
- Uses technical indicators like:
  - Moving averages (5-day, 10-day)
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Daily range, volume, return, and more
- Frontend built with HTML/CSS + JavaScript
- Backend built with Flask
- Displays model confidence, accuracy, and prediction

ðŸ§  Model
- Binary classification: predicts if the next dayâ€™s close will be higher than todayâ€™s
- Trained on historical stock data (e.g. from 2010â€“present)
- Accuracy hovers around ~52â€“54% depending on ticker

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- yfinance
- joblib
- ta (technical analysis)
- Flask
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
